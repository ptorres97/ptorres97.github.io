        <h1>CSS Tutorial</h1>

        <p>
            CSS is a language that describes the style of an HTML document. It describes how HTML elements should be displayed. 
            It stands for Cascading Style Sheets, they are very useful because they can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Why?</h2>

        <p>
            HTML was never intended to contain tags for formatting a webpage. It was created to describe the content of the webpage.
            When tags like &lt;font&gt;, and color attributes were added to HTML 3.2 specification, it became a nightmare for web developers.
            It became a long and expensive process. To solve it, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
        </p>

        <h2>Syntax:</h2>

        <div>
            A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block. Example:
            <p style="text-indent: 20px;">h1 {color:blue; font-size:12px;}</span>
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.</li>
            <li>The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.</li>
            <li>Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.</li>
            <li>A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Selectors:</h2>

        <p>
            Are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their element name, id, class, attribute and more.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Element selector: selects elements based on the element name. (name )</li>
            <li>ID selector: uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. This id should be unique 
                within a page. (#id)</li>
            <li>Class selector: selects elements with a specific class attribute. All the elements of the same class will be 
                selected. (.class)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3 ways to insert CSS</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>External style sheet: you can change the style of an entire website by changing just one file. Each page must 
                include a reference to the external style sheet file</li>
            <li>Internal style sheet: this is used to style a single page. This is defined in the &lt;style&gt; element, 
                inside the &lt;head&gt; section</li>
            <li>Inline styles: may be used to style a single element. To use them, add the style attribute to the element</li>
            <li>Multiple style sheets: If some properties have been defined for the same selector in different style sheets, 
                the value from the last real stylesheet will be used</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Colors</h2>

        <div>
            <h3>Types of Colors:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li style="background-color: cyan;">background-color</li>
                <li style="color: darkmagenta;">color (text color)</li>
            </ul>
